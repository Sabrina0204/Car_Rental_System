# The description of this Car Rental System project

In the breakdown of our car rental system, we organized it into **six** modules, each further subdivided into specific sub-modules. These include the **User Management Module, Vehicle Management Module, Positive Feedback and User Feedback Module, Appointment Module, Payment Module, and Business Reporting and Statistics Module**. Each module has distinct functionalities, and the seamless interaction between them constitutes the overall system implementation. Our chosen solution adopts the **MVC** architecture, allowing for the independent development, testing, and maintenance of each component. Java, coupled with the SpringBoot framework, was employed to streamline the development and deployment processes. The front-end leverages the Bootstrap framework, while the back-end utilizes the MySQL database. Below is the system architecture. I have also included a **demonstration video** in the file.
